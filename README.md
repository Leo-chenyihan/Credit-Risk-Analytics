## Credit Risk Analytics: Default Modeling & Rating Transition Analysis
# Overview
This project implements a full-cycle credit risk analytics pipeline using historical issuer-level ratings from S&P. It estimates multi-year default probabilities, identifies rating withdrawals, and visualizes average pre-default/withdrawal rating paths. The modeling framework is designed to support internal risk monitoring, portfolio surveillance, and regulatory-aligned PD estimation.
